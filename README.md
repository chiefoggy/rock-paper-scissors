# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundation Track, where I built an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What started as a simple console-based game with prompts has evolved into a more feature-rich, user-friendly version with dynamic styling and full responsiveness for mobile devices.
<br /><h2>Project Overview:

Initially, the game had a simple pop-up interface with text-based prompts. In this version, I enhanced the game by adding a graphical user interface (UI), making it more engaging. I also incorporated features like score tracking and responsive design to ensure it looks good on any screen size.

The project provided an excellent opportunity to dive deeper into working with the JavaScript DOM, manipulating HTML elements, and applying CSS for layout and responsiveness. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, including commands like git push, commit, branch, and handling merge conflicts.

## Features
<ul>
    <li>Interactive UI: The game now includes buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors for the user to click.</li>
    <li>Score Tracking: The user's score and the computer's score are displayed and updated after each round.</li>
    <li>Game Over State: The game ends when either the user or the computer reaches 5 points, and a winner message is displayed</li>
    <li>Responsive Design: The layout is mobile-friendly, ensuring it looks good on any screen size.</li>
    <li>Game Flow: After the user makes a selection, the game displays the result (win, loss, or draw), updates the score, and checks if the game has ended</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>HTML: For the basic structure of the game.</li>
    <li>CSS: For styling and making the page responsive.</li>
    <li>JavaScript: For the game logic and DOM manipulation.</li>
    <li>Git: For version control and project management.</li>
</ul>

## How to Play
<ul>
    <li>Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking one of the buttons.</li>
    <li>The computer will randomly select one of the three options.</li>
    <li>The round will be evaluated, and your score will be updated.</li>
    <li>The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches 5 points. A winner message will be displayed.</li>
</ul>

## Future Improvements
<ul>
    <li>Game Reset: Currently, the user could only play a limited amount of rounds. In future iterations (if I ever get to it), the user can restart the game with a button that resets the scores and re-enables the game buttons.</li>
</ul>
